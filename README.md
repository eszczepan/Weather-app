## :pencil: Description

Weather app is progressive web application where we can check the weather around the world.  
</br>
A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser. Functionality includes working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices.  
</br>
The application uses an external API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides access current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities.
